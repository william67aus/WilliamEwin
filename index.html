  <div class="difff">
    <p>My name is William Ewin, I am a university student studying a Bachelor of Design (Digital Media) at
      RMIT University. My work tends to revolve around my hometown and the environment in which I grew up in. Due to
      living in the city, I realised the many things that I took for granted, and I utilise these aspects in my work,
      highlighting the places that I miss most. Through my future work, I hope to express more areas of the coastal
      town,
      showcasing how much of a beautiful place it is.</p>

  <h2>Project 1:</h2>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="column">
      <h3>New Town</h3>
      <p class="text">New Town is a video that I manipulated to produce an entirely new narrative. Recreating the main
        character to
        be portrayed as psychotic, I highlighted a drastic change in his environment, resulting in him reaching his
        breaking point. Using background music and sound effects, I further emphasized the videoâ€™s key areas, assisting
        the viewer in understanding what is happening to the protagonist. I chose this concept due to how easily the
        initial video could be manipulated to create whatever narrative I wanted, resulting in the project that you see
        before you.</p>

    <h2>Project 2:</h2>
    <div class="column">
      <h3>Elements of Nature</h3>
      <p class="text">My idea behind the icons was to portray the natural elements that are in our environment and
        produce icons that
        relate to each one. My initial prompt was nature, I wanted to showcase the different sides of that, thinking of
        weather and time. I used monographic colours for each icon having a different overall colour for each,
        showcasing the colours that I felt were most appropriate for each element. I tried to pay close attention to the
        initial thought of 'what would this icon sound like. Through this I found some odd sounds to portray some icons.

      <h3>Two Worlds</h3>
      <p class="text">Two Worlds is a concept revolving around my move from a small coastal town to the city of
        Melbourne. I wanted
        to portray key features of my hometown to help showcase where I grew up and provide the player with an
        experience that I used to have almost daily. Through the use of sound, I was able to create two contrasting
        environments and produce an atmosphere that I wanted the players to experience. I wanted to achieve a game with
        two separate environments but enticed the player to one of them specifically. </p>
